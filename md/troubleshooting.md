# GPosingway Troubleshooting Guide (Simplified)

If you're having trouble with GPosingway, here are some things to try:

**Installation Problems**

### GPosingway isn't working after installing
  * Make sure you have the right version of GPosingway for your ReShade.
  * If you're using the installer script, put the file directly in your main FFXIV folder.
  * If you're installing from the zip file, extract the files to your main FFXIV folder.
  * If you already have ReShade installed, rename the old shader and preset folders to avoid conflicts.

### Error messages during install or when starting FFXIV
  * Check for conflicts with other mods, especially Dalamud.
  * Delete the "dxgi.log" file in your FFXIV folder and restart the game.

### Presets look wrong or cause glitches
  * If you're using shaders from other sources, they might be conflicting. Most preset collections should work fine with GPosingway without needing extra shaders.

**Other Problems**

### Can't find GPosingway presets
  * Look in the "reshade-presets" folder in your game folder.
  * Open the ReShade menu in the game (usually by pressing Home) and find the Presets tab.

### FFXIV is running slower with GPosingway
  * Press Shift + F2 to turn effects on and off.
  * Turn off any shaders you're not using.

### Important Reminders
  * **Back up your files:** Always make a copy of your FFXIV game files before installing any tools, just in case.
  * **Compatibility:** GPosingway works best with certain versions of ReShade and FFXIV. Make sure you're using the right ones.
